FileSystemSnarl is a tool which watches a directory for changes (file creation, changing, renaming and deletion) and then initiates a notification using the notification System Snarl (http://www.getsnarl.info/).

It needs the .NET Framework 3.5 to be installed (which is the default on Windows 7).

Its options include the selection which events to watch, filter for certain changes only, include sub directories and the Snarl notifications can be configured flexible using placeholders.

The Snarl notifications also include an action menu where you can choose between various options to start on the file.
